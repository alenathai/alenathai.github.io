        <h1>DIN vs. Interstate </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>DIN</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>The origin of the DIN typeface traces back to early 20th century Germany when efforts to standardize and create unified standards across industries were prioritized. The original version of this sans-serif font, DIN 1451, was created by engineer Ludwig Goller in 1936. He sought to create a legible typeface that could be used for public signage. Goller based the typeface on Royal Prussian Railways from 1906, which had a standardized lettering system for marking freight cars and road signs. Goller, who served as the chairman of the DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung) committee, or German Institute for Standardization, helped formalize the typeface. The name of the typeface was named after the institution. Due to DIN’s clarity and legibility, it was officially adopted as the standard typeface for German traffic signs and public signage.</p>
             
			 <h3>Interstate</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->
             <p>Interstate was designed by type designer Tobias Frere-Jones based in New York City. The variable font was released through Font Bureau in 1993 and is a reinterpretation of “Highway Gothic”, the official typeface of the American Federal Highway Administration. Highway Gothic was designed by engineer Theodore W. Forbes in 1949, intended to enhance the legibility of lettering on US interstate highway signs. Some letterforms of Highway Gothic were too quirky and did not follow traditional typography standards, prompting Frere-Jones to reinvent Highway Gothic and create Interstate, which was more refined and intentionally designed while still paying homage to the original’s unique charm.</p>
